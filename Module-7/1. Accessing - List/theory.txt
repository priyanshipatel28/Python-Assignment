1) Understanding how to create and access elements in a list. 
--> List is represesnt by [] bracket.
we can create list in both dynamic and ststic way.
(In static, programmer will manually do it, while in dynamis used will provide elements for list)
e.g : static
l1 = [1,2,3]
print(l1)

e.g: dynamic
l1 = []# a empty list is created to input element from user
for i in range(1,3):#loop will rotate for 2 times
    num = int(input('Enter any number: '))
    l1.append(num) # append is a method in list to insert element at the end of the list.
print(l1)


2) Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing). 
---> In list to access element betwenn a specific range we are using index.
e.g : l1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
posi..index: 0  1  2  3  4
nega..index:-5 -4 -3 -2 -1

to get last elemtn in list with negative Indexing -- >print(l1[-1])
to get first elemtn in list with negative Indexing -- >print(l1[-5])
to get first element in list with positive indexinf -- >print(l1[0])
to get last element in list with positive indexinf -- >print(l1[4])

3) Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements.
-->To access the element, the syntax is [start:end]
start = the string point
end = the ending point

e.g: if you want to eccess the first 3 element with indexing.
--> print(l1[0:3])
same as for negative indexing.
--> print(l1[-5:-2])
