Iterating over a dictionary using loops. 
--->You can use a for loop to iterate through the keys, values, or both in a dictionary.

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict:
    print(f"Key: {key}")
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(f"Value: {value}")
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")
