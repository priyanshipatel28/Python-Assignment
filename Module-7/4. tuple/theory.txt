Introduction to tuples, immutability. 
-->tuple = tuple is a collection data type which contain similar and dis-similar data elements

tuple which is contain duplicate elements
tuple which is reperesent by () parenthesis

difference:-  list and tuple

list is slower than tuple

list can mutable but tuple can't mutable means we can't change it value.
means there is no method like append, extend, remove.... in tuple.

2) Creating and accessing elements in a tuple.
---> tuples are Created by parenthesis,and the element in tuple can't be changed.

t1= (1,12,45,23,26)
print(t1)  # (1,12,45,23,26)

-->to access the lement in tuple
print(t1[0])   #  1
--> to access the last element in tuple
print(t1[-1])  # 26
-->
3) Basic operations with tuples: concatenation, repetition, membership. 
--->Concatenation combines two or more tuples to create a new tuple.
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)

output:-->
        #(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

--->Repetition is a way to create a new tuple by repeating 
the elements of an existing tuple multiple times
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
repeated_tuple = tuple1 * 3  # Repeat the tuple 3 times
print(repeated_tuple)

output:-->
        #(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

--->Membership checks if an element exists in a tuple and returns True or False.
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
print(20 in tuple1)   # Check if 20 is in the tuple
print(50 in tuple1)   # Check if 50 is in the tuple

output:-->
        #True
        False
